"""Import-graph guard for the shipped package.

Two complementary walks assert the same rule: every import root reachable from
``tai42_channel_twilio`` is on the allowlist. The rule (see the README): the shipped
package imports
the HTTP surface (httpx + starlette), the shared platform substrate
(tai42-contract + tai42-kit with the redis extra, pydantic, pydantic-settings)
and their dependency closure ONLY, plus the Python standard library. Anything
else -- a package that is not a declared dependency of the shipped wheel -- is
absent from the allowlist and fails the test loudly.

The runtime walk imports ``tai42_channel_twilio`` and every submodule in a fresh
subprocess, then inspects ``sys.modules``. Running it in a subprocess that
imports ONLY ``tai42_channel_twilio`` means the assertion covers the SHIPPED package's
true import closure and never observes roots that a sibling test module or a
conftest pulled into this process's global ``sys.modules``. A submodule that
fails to import raises loudly and fails the test too.

The static walk parses every shipped source file and collects import roots at
ANY nesting depth. This is what catches an import that the runtime walk cannot
see: one placed inside a function body, a class body, or a ``TYPE_CHECKING``
block never executes on a plain package import, so it would leave no trace in
``sys.modules``. Both walks share one allowlist, so neither is a weaker gate.
